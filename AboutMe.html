                <p class = "info">My name is Tamjid Hossain. I am currently a third year student studying Computational
                    Media at Georgia Tech and am specifically pursuing a concentration in film and media studies and hope to pursue a career in those fields. My favorite films include Grave of the Fireflies, Wolf Children, Star Wars Episodes 4 - 6 and The Dark Knight Trilogy by Christopher Nolan. I like to spend my free time watching animated series such as Naruto and Avatar: The Last Airbender to observe how scenes get animated and spend time engaged in outdoor activities. I also have experience in Java and am currently learning to use HTML, CSS and Javascript. In the future, I hope to not only gain more experience in these languages but also pick up new languages such as C and utilize them in more projects.
